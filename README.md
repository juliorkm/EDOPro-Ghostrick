# Custom Ghostrick

This project attempts to enhance the existing [Ghostrick](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick) archetype by mixing elements from [Pumpking the King of Ghosts](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pumpking_the_King_of_Ghosts) in 3 new support cards.

## How to Install

This project requires [EDOPro by ProjectIgnis](https://twitter.com/ProjectIgnisYGO/).

Add contents of the folders `expansions`, `pics` and `script` to the respective folders in your EDOPro folder. Optionally, add the contents of the `deck` folder as well to have a sample deck that uses these custom cards.

## Thematic decisions

"[Ghostrick](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick)" is an archetype in Yu-Gi-Oh! that features cute versions of various folklore and Halloween characters. It is used by the Duel Links incarnation of [Bonz](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bonz_(Duel_Links)), whose ace monster is [Pumpking the King of Ghosts](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pumpking_the_King_of_Ghosts_(Duel_Links)) according to himself:

"My ace monster is... Pumpking the King of Ghosts! The ones I'm enjoying these days are these freaky fellas. Ghostricks! They're not the strongest, and a bit tricky to use... But I can relate with these not-so-spooky specters. I'll keep gathering many different Ghost Cards to become the Duel King of the great beyond!"  
-Bonz, during his unlock event in Duel Links

Bonz often calls his monsters "Ghost Cards" (「**ゴースト**・カード」), so him using "Ghostricks" (「**ゴースト**リック」) feels appropriate. Since Pumpking is "the King of Ghosts", it's only natural that Bonz would also want to make him the king of his new ghosts, the Ghostricks.

## The cards

### Pumpking the King of Ghostricks

</p>

* The new boss monster of the archetype.
* Utilizes Contact Fusion instead of Xyz for 2 reasons: [this mechanic canonically existed in Bonz's time](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/XYZ-Dragon_Cannon_(anime)) and it can be done with face-down Defense Position monsters, which is a common position for Ghostricks to be in.
* The materials are generic enough for the Summon to be made with any 2 Ghostricks, as well as allowing for some engines with DARK monsters to synergize with the archetype.
* This monster helps with 2 major issues in the archetype: swarming and gaining card advantage.
* This monster's name is a play on its japanese name (「**ゴースト**王－パンプキング－」) and the naming convention of Ghostrick monsters (they all start with 「**ゴースト**リック」). In Japanese, it would be named 「**ゴーストリック**王－パンプキング－」.
* **Note:** Artwork is an edit based on [Pumpking's appearance](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pumpking_the_King_of_Ghosts_(Duel_Arena)) in *Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Arena*.

### Ghostrick Ectoplasm Fortification

</p>

* A new Continuous Trap for the archetype.
* Based on Pumpking's signature move in the anime, Ectoplasm Fortification, where it injects ectoplasm in Ghost monsters to increase their ATK.
* This trap helps with 2 major issues in the archetype: swarming and low ATK points, and consequentially also helps beating over Link Monsters as those can't be flipped face-down.
* Monsters summoned with this effect are great targets for cards such as [Ghostrick Scare](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Scare) and [Ghostrick-Go-Round](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick-Go-Round), as they can be summoned during your opponent's turn.
* Monsters summoned with this effect during your opponent's End Phase can be used as Xyz/Link Material during your turn (or even as steps into [Ghostrick Angel of Mischief](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Angel_of_Mischief), if using Xyz Monsters in the GY), while monsters summoned during your turn can be used as Contact Fusion Material.
* **Note:** Artwork is an edit of a scene from [Episode 18, "Arena of Lost Souls, Part 2"](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_-_Episode_018).

### Ghostrick Pumpkingdom

</p>

* A new Field Spell for the archetype.
* Retains the common effect among all "Ghostrick" Field Spells (all attacks ignore face-down monsters).
* Has a damage-related downside like all other "Ghostrick" Field Spells ([Mansion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Mansion) halves the damage of your non-Ghostrick monsters, [Museum](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Museum) keeps your non-Ghostrick monsters from attacking and [Parade](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Parade) keeps you from doing damage altogether).
* In high-risk high-reward fashion, this Field Spell turns things such as [Ghostrick Scare](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Scare) and [Ghostrick-Go-Round](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick-Go-Round) searched off of Pumpking into hand traps, allowing for more disruption with the risk of taking massive damage.
* Can be quickly tagged out for [Ghostrick Mansion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Mansion) through [Ghostrick Renovation](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghostrick_Renovation).
* **Note:** Artwork is an edit of the "Bonz's Spooky Zombie Party" [playmat from Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Links_playmats#Event_Playmats).
